I am creating this project for my portfolio using UE5 and C++. A game in the genre of RTS and TD. The game has a version for PC (for quick testing) and Android. I was inspired by the computer game "Perimeter", but I'm not making a clone.

Now the game implements the construction of an energy network, the logic of the player's camera, the behavior model of units and the destruction of towers.
